#Hrust 1.3 / Hrum 3.5 PC version sources

---

These are PC versions of well known packers for ZX Spectrum by Hrumer.
They are 100% identical to Spectrum's version. But using of them is not
recommended since there are newer and better packers:
[mhmt](https://code.google.com/p/mhmt/) or
[ZX7](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0027996).
